Basic instructions on use:

This game is a text-based rpg with the implementation of a basic in-text map.
to run the game, simply execute the "main" class file found in the repository.
from here, you will be prompted whether to start the game.

When shown the map, keep in mind the following legend:

@: this is the player marker and shows your current position

$: this is an enemy marker, showing the position of an enemy

. : this dot represents a space that the player can move to in the map

#: this is an impassible wall. They are found on the periphery of the map and throughout it

To move around the map, you must type out the direction you want to move, ie "right", and press enter
on the keyboard. You should see the @ symbol move in the direction you specified, unless you are moving
into a wall

To start combat, move onto the same space occupied by the $ sign representing an enemy. You will then
be presented with the combat menu, prompting you to start combat and then to choose a weapon.
Combat is done in rounds, and structured like rock, paper, scissors. Choose one type of attack each round,
and the enemy will also choose an attack. The result is then read out. When you choose the "flee" option, or
you or the enemy dies, combat will end and you will return to the map

To see the player's current stats, type "stats" while in the map

To quit the game, type "quit" while in the map
